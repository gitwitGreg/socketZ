This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
# Title
socketZ

# Description
- This is complex chat application which users can send and recive messages in real time.
- Users can have not only send private messages but they can also create group chats to have conversations with multiple users at once.
- Users get to customize thier profile and display a profile picture and bio.

# Why
- After completing my social media application, I wanted to reinforce the skills I had learned and incorporate some new technologies. Creating a chat application was the perfect place to progress because it introduced me to web sockets. I enjoyed the process of building a full-stack application while trying to incorporate a web socket.
  
# Quick start
- Install socketZ by downloading zip folder
- Run in terminal with npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
